        "review": "A top-tier action film in my book, this movie showcases Heath Ledger and Christian Bale at their best, delivering invigorating and complex performances. Centered around Bruce Wayne's internal struggle and his mission to save Gotham, Christopher Nolan crafts a cinematic masterpiece. The film is elevated by the Joker’s chilling presence, stunning cinematography, a powerful score, and an exceptional cast. This is undoubtedly one of my highest-rated films—a must-watch that exemplifies what much of the action genre is missing today."

        "review": "Off of a friend's recommendation, I was hesitant towards this show at first. But after 28 episodes in 2 days, I can safely say I was and still am hooked. The Bear displays the divergence between passion and its equal and opposite force: the fear of failure. The journey of Carmy, through constant failure and disaster, presents the human experience in its fullest form. What quickly became a top show for me, I'm excited for the future seasons and journey of Carmy, Sydney, and Richie."

        "review": "First, this ranking will not include Season 6, for I think that's a completely separate show in my opinion. Kevin Spacey portrays the character of Frank Underwood to a T, a power-hungry sociopath who really never stops at nothing on his conquest to the top. Although I believe the show loses its suspense past the second season, I still find the acting, writing, and emotion to be top tier. I don't believe there will be a better political drama ever, but I still hope for one."

        "review": "I was able to experience this movie in a 70mm theater for the first time, to which I can say I was blown away. The cinematography and score were my biggest takeaways from this movie, as I found it to be much more impressive in those matters. The acting, plot, and storytelling were all fantastic, but I did feel like it lacked the depth that other Nolan films had, especially in the last third of the movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed it, especially going through the mind of Oppenheimer himself and the catastrophic effects the Manhattan Project had on him."

        "review": "Psych was pretty much my introduction to real television, and I still keep it as one of my favorite TV shows. The light-hearted, comedic duo of Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster are a classic, and the show's ability to pair such with crime-solving plots makes it a fantastic watch. I especially enjoyed the yin-yang episodes, for I felt those were the most serious moments in the show where we really see the abilities of Shawn Spencer at a 100%. My favorite part of the show had to be Gus's nicknames, my favorite being Sh'Dynasy (comma to the top that's God's comma)."

        "review": "I was never a fan of musicals, but La La Land changed that for me. What was a simple, romance story turned into an emotional rollercoaster off of the stunning chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. I believe the film's score and cinematography, especially the usage of color, were some of the film's strongest suits and were what really made this film stand out from the rest in 2016. Damien Chazelle was able to one-up himself from 'Whiplash,' as this film set a new standard for musicals."

        "review": "Mad Max seems like a typical action movie with little to no plot. And I won't lie, the plot is pretty barren. The reason anyone watches this movie is simply the outstanding stunts and action sequences. George Miller is a pretty crazy guy to not have any CGI in this film, especially after seeing certain sequences. So while the movie lacks a lot of the things that I typically look for in a great film, it makes up for it with the incredible, jaw dropping action sequences that'll never be replicated."

The show consistently has comedy in every sequence, but something I loved about it was how many lessons I could take away from the show to my own life. I felt that it was incredibly thought provoking, but at the same time, could make me laugh for days. Although I will forever oppose the ending, Ted, Barney, Robin, Lily, and Marshall are the greatest group of friends I've ever seen."
