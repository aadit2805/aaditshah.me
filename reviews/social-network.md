When I was shown this film, I was skeptical at first. I mean, how good can a biopic about a student creating a social media platform be? And from there, I was clearly mistaken. 

First, the pacing was incredible. Fast in the right areas, slow when needed, it fit the metric of what Facebook was all about at the time. 

The soundtrack complements perfectly and ties the film together, from the beginning scene walking through Harvard Yard, the crew race in Holland, to the pulsating track playing through the creation of FaceMash. 

And lastly, the actors. The dichomity of Eisenberg and Garfield, best friends to worst enemies, was portrayed perfectly. While one was rooted in loyatly, the other was rooted in ruthlessness. Together, they created one of the most memorable films of the decade, perfectly encapsualting the true story of Facebook's creation and the lives destroyed in the process, showcased through their climax scene near the end where fame drew a wedge in their friendship.
