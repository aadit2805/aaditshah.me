Off of a friend's recommendation, I was hesitant towards this show at first. But after 28 episodes in 2 days, I can safely say I was and still am hooked. The Bear displays the divergence between passion and its equal and opposite force: the fear of failure. The journey of Carmy, through constant failure and disaster, presents the human experience in its fullest form. What quickly became a top show for me, I'm excited for the future seasons and journey of Carmy, Sydney, and Richie.
