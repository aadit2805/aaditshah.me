First, this ranking will not include Season 6, for I think that's a completely separate show in my opinion. Kevin Spacey portrays the character of Frank Underwood to a T, a power-hungry sociopath who really never stops at nothing on his conquest to the top. Although I believe the show loses its suspense past the second season, I still find the acting, writing, and emotion to be top tier. I don't believe there will be a better political drama ever, but I still hope for one.
