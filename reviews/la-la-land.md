I was never a fan of musicals, but La La Land changed that for me. What was a simple, romance story turned into an emotional rollercoaster off of the stunning chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. I believe the film's score and cinematography, especially the usage of color, were some of the film's strongest suits and were what really made this film stand out from the rest in 2016. Damien Chazelle was able to one-up himself from 'Whiplash,' as this film set a new standard for musicals.
