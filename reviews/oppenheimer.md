I was able to experience this movie in a 70mm theater for the first time, to which I can say I was blown away. The cinematography and score were my biggest takeaways from this movie, as I found it to be much more impressive in those matters. The acting, plot, and storytelling were all fantastic, but I did feel like it lacked the depth that other Nolan films had, especially in the last third of the movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed it, especially going through the mind of Oppenheimer himself and the catastrophic effects the Manhattan Project had on him.
