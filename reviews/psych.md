Psych was pretty much my introduction to real television, and I still keep it as one of my favorite TV shows. The light-hearted, comedic duo of Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster are a classic, and the show's ability to pair such with crime-solving plots makes it a fantastic watch. I especially enjoyed the yin-yang episodes, for I felt those were the most serious moments in the show where we really see the abilities of Shawn Spencer at a 100%. My favorite part of the show had to be Gus's nicknames, my favorite being Sh'Dynasy (comma to the top that's God's comma).
