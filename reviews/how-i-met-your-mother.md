I've just finished my first watch of this show, and it will forever be my comfort show. The show consistently has comedy in every sequence, but something I loved about it was how many lessons I could take away from the show to my own life. I felt that it was incredibly thought provoking, but at the same time, could make me laugh for days. Although I will forever oppose the ending, Ted, Barney, Robin, Lily, and Marshall are the greatest group of friends I've ever seen.
