I'm essentially combining my review of Part One with this, as Part One serves more as a stepping stone and lacks much of the plot, which is more than made up for in this extraordinary film. I was able to watch it in IMAX, and I was quite amazedâ€”there's no other way to explain it. The acting was powerful, to the point where I slowly felt like I was becoming a believer in the prophecy. Chalamet's performance is hands down some of the best I have seen recently, fully embracing the role of a messiah and playing it to perfection. In IMAX, I was truly able to grasp the cinematography and score that had been praised so highly. Zimmer once again does an excellent job of tying the soundtrack seamlessly with Villeneuve's vision. I am extremely excited to see what Part 3 has in store and curious to see if the Dune trilogy will become the greatest trilogy of all time.
