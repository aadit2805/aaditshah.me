Mad Max seems like a typical action movie with little to no plot. And I won't lie, the plot is pretty barren. The reason anyone watches this movie is simply the outstanding stunts and action sequences. George Miller is a pretty crazy guy to not have any CGI in this film, especially after seeing certain sequences. So while the movie lacks a lot of the things that I typically look for in a great film, it makes up for it with the incredible, jaw dropping action sequences that'll never be replicated.
